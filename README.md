## About

> The "go_version" and "tauri_version" are **old** versions of this app, and should be treated as archive that may or may not work anymore.
>
> **The active version of this app is "wfns_manager"**

This app was made thanks to **Relm4** rust gtk framework (so not in electron!): [`wfns_manager`](https://github.com/Ilingu/random-folder/tree/main/wfns_manager)

## Install

### ⚡ `[DISCLAIMER]`:: This app is not production ready and will never be, it's just a side project of mine to test the so called "relm4" framework

### 🪟 If you have linux fedora (42) you can download the app binary in the [`realease page`](https://github.com/Ilingu/random-folder/releases) of this repo

Otherwise to install this app you will have to bundle it yourself (since it was not design to be installed) via [`cargo`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/cargo/guide/)

## Purpose and motivation

The idea of this app come from a very specific problem that I encounter in a daily basis 😉. So to automate this problem I build this app (logical 🪄)
